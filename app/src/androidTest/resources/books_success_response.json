        "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become pervasive in most areas of research and applications. While computation can significantly reduce mental efforts for complex problem solving, effective computer algorithms allow continuous improvement of AI tools to handle complexity—in both time and memory requirements—for machine learning in large datasets. Meanwhile, data science is an evolving scientific discipline that strives to overcome the hindrance of traditional skills that are too limited to enable scientific discovery when leveraging research outcomes. Solutions to many problems in medicine and life science, which cannot be answered by these conventional approaches, are urgently needed for society. This edited book attempts to report recent advances in the complementary domains of AI, computation, and data science with applications in medicine and life science. The benefits to the reader are manifold as researchers from similar or different fields can be aware of advanced developments and novel applications that can be useful for either immediate implementations or future scientific pursuit. Features: Considers recent advances in AI, computation, and data science for solving complex problems in medicine, physiology, biology, chemistry, and biochemistry Provides recent developments in three evolving key areas and their complementary combinations: AI, computation, and data science Reports on applications in medicine and physiology, including cancer, neuroscience, and digital pathology Examines applications in life science, including systems biology, biochemistry, and even food technology This unique book, representing research from a team of international contributors, has not only real utility in academia for those in the medical and life sciences communities, but also a much wider readership from industry, science, and other areas of technology and education.",

A job analysis was conducted to identify AI-related job tasks performed by Army civilians and the knowledge areas (i.e. competencies) that are necessary to successfully perform them. Four one-on-one interviews and two workshops were used to develop comprehensive lists of AI-related job tasks and associated competencies. A job analysis survey was completed by 171 incumbents. The competency standards were developed at three workshops using the job analysis information. Competencies identified as the most important to successful job performance across different types of Army civilian jobs form the bases for the certification standards. To be certified, applicants will need to demonstrate that they have had sufficient amounts of education or experience or combinations of the two for all of the 6 'core competencies' and for three of the 18 'supplemental competencies.'",

        "description": "Get the tools, resources and insights you need to explore artificial intelligence in the classroom and explore what students need to know about living in a world with AI. For many, artificial intelligence, or AI, may seem like science fiction, or inherently overwhelming. The reality is that AI is already being applied in industry and, for many of us, in our daily lives as well. A better understanding of AI can help you make informed decisions in the classroom that will impact the future of your students. Drawing from a broad variety of expert voices from countries including Australia, Japan, and South Africa, as well as educators from around the world and underrepresented student voices, this book explores some of the ways AI can improve education. These include educating learners about AI, teaching them about living in a world where they will be surrounded by AI and helping educators understand how they can use AI to augment human ability. Each chapter offers activities and questions to help you deepen your understanding, try out new concepts and reflect on the information presented. Links to media artifacts from trusted sources will help make your learning experience more dynamic while also providing additional resources to use in your classroom. This book: • Offers a unique approach to the topic, with chapter opening scenes, case studies, and featured student voices. • Discusses a variety of ways to teach students about AI, through design thinking, project-based learning and STEM connections. • Includes lesson ideas, activities and tools for exploring AI with your students. • Includes references to films and other media you can use in class to start discussions on AI or inspire design thinking and STEM projects. In Teaching AI, you’ll learn what AI is, how it works and how to use it to better prepare students in a world with increased human-computer interaction.",

        "description": "Analytics and artificial intelligence (AI), what are they good for? The bandwagon keeps answering, absolutely everything! Analytics and artificial intelligence have captured the attention of everyone from top executives to the person in the street. While these disciplines have a relatively long history, within the last ten or so years they have exploded into corporate business and public consciousness. Organizations have rushed to embrace data-driven decision making. Companies everywhere are turning out products boasting that \"artificial intelligence is included.\" We are indeed living in exciting times. The question we need to ask is, do we really know how to get business value from these exciting tools? Unfortunately, both the analytics and AI communities have not done a great job in collaborating and communicating with each other to build the necessary synergies. This book bridges the gap between these two critical fields. The book begins by explaining the commonalities and differences in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and autonomy by giving a historical perspective for each of these fields, followed by exploration of common technologies and current trends in each field. The book also readers introduces to applications of deep learning in industry with an overview of deep learning and its key architectures, as well as a survey and discussion of the main applications of deep learning. The book also presents case studies to illustrate applications of AI and analytics. These include a case study from the healthcare industry and an investigation of a digital transformation enabled by AI and analytics transforming a product-oriented company into one delivering solutions and services. The book concludes with a proposed AI-informed data analytics life cycle to be applied to unstructured data.",

One of the human mind’s most valuable features is the capacity to formulate creative thoughts, an ability that through quantum leap innovations has propelled us to the current digital age. However, creative breakthroughs are easier said than done. Appearing less frequently and more sporadically than desired, it seems that we have not yet fully cracked the creative code. But with the rapid advances in artificial intelligence which have come to provide an ever-closer proximity with the cognitive faculties of mankind, can this emerging technology improve our creative capabilities? What will that look like and will it be the missing link in the man–machine enigma? AI for Creativity provides a fascinating look at what is currently emerging in the very cutting-edge area of artificial intelligence and the tools being developed to enable computational creativity that holds the propensity to dramatically change our lives.",

        "description": "To be a good teacher, one must acquire a large set of different kinds of interdisciplinary knowledge. Education for teachers and trainers consists, in part, of learning the language of education and the appropriate associated skills. A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language. On a systemic level, the education system needs to consider the individual as the basic building block of society, and further take into consideration the individual’s consciousness related to their emotional intelligence. Because a person’s consciousness is something entirely singular and inherent to the individual, some kind of generalization will have to be constructed, which will contribute enough in terms of novelty and progress, to make it innovative enough for the purposes of teaching and learning. This volume will serve to provoke cognitive dissonance and intellectual unease, as it explores cognitive theories and inspires researchers and teachers to update and invigorate some of the theories that have been embedded in their minds since their own school years. In order for this to happen, the book provides readers with many valuable insights and introduces new experiences resulting from alternative teaching practices.",

To assist the me- anism, we assume that it can communicate with an Environment (“Oracle”) which guides it with information regarding the direction in which it should go. If the Environment is deterministic the problem is the “Deterministic Point - cation Problem” which has been studied rather thoroughly [1]. In its pioneering version [1] the problem was presented in the setting that the Environment could charge the robot a cost which was proportional to the distance it was from the point sought for. The question of having multiple communicating robots locate a point on the line has also been studied [1, 2]. In the stochastic version of this problem, we consider the scenario when the learning mechanism attempts to locate a point in an interval with stochastic (i. e. , possibly erroneous) instead of deterministic responses from the environment. Thus when it should really be moving to the “right” it may be advised to move to the “left” and vice versa. Apart from the problem being of importance in its own right, the stoch- tic pointlocationproblemalsohas potentialapplications insolvingoptimization problems. Inmanyoptimizationsolutions–forexampleinimageprocessing,p- tern recognition and neural computing [5, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19], the algorithm worksits wayfromits currentsolutionto the optimalsolutionbasedoninfor- tion that it currentlyhas.

It is now everywhere in your life. That personalised advertising folder from the supermarket with offers “especially for you”? AI. The songs suggested for you on Spotify? AI. The self-regulating traffic lights on the corner of your street? AI. It is undeniable that AI is entering our lives at a dizzying speed. It is now part of our everyday world, and also penetrating business sectors everywhere. This raises many questions. What can AI do? What can it not do? To what extent is AI really intelligent and how far does it add value to our lives? AI expert Geertrui Mieke De Ketelaere has been closely involved in the developments in this fascinating world for many years. In this book, she explains the basic concepts of artificial intelligence in an accessible and transparent way. She discusses the many opportunities that AI offers, but does not neglect the risks. De Ketelaere takes you beyond the hype, allowing you to participate in this fascinating debate in an informed manner. One truth is clear: AI is already important, and it will be crucial for our future.",

Artificial Intelligence has a real impact on our lives and on our environment, and the Sustainable Development Goals enable us to evaluate these impacts in a systematic manner. This book shows that doing so requires us to understand the context of AI – the infrastructure it is built on, who develops it, who owns it, who has access to it, who uses it, and what it is used for – rather than relying on an isolationist theory of technology. By doing so, we can analyze not only the direct effects of AI on sustainability, but also the indirect – or second-order – effects. AI for the Sustainable Development Goals shows how AI potentially affects all SDGs – both positively and negatively.",

        "description": "This book is divided into two parts, the first of which describes AI as we know it today, in particular the Fintech-related applications. In turn, the second part explores AI models in financial markets: both regarding applications that are already available (e.g. the blockchain supply chain, learning through big data, understanding natural language, or the valuation of complex bonds) and more futuristic solutions (e.g. models based on artificial agents that interact by buying and selling stocks within simulated worlds). The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are starting to show their financial effects: more companies in a liquidity crisis; more unstable debt positions; and more loans from international institutions for states and large companies. At the same time, we are witnessing a growth of AI technologies in all fields, from the production of goods and services, to the management of socio-economic infrastructures: in medicine, communications, education, and security. The question then becomes: could we imagine integrating AI technologies into the financial markets, in order to improve their performance? And not just limited to using AI to improve performance in high-frequency trading or in the study of trends. Could we imagine AI technologies that make financial markets safer, more stable, and more comprehensible? The book explores these questions, pursuing an approach closely linked to real-world applications. The book is intended for three main categories of readers: (1) management-level employees of companies operating in the financial markets, banks, insurance operators, portfolio managers, brokers, risk assessors, investment managers, and debt managers; (2) policymakers and regulators for financial markets, from government technicians to politicians; and (3) readers curious about technology, both for professional and private purposes, as well as those involved in innovation and research in the private and public spheres.",

The main aims of this annual conference are to promote AI research in Ireland, to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas amongst the different disciplines concerned with the study of cognition, and to provide an opportunity for industry to see what research is being carried out in Ireland and how they might benefit from the results of this research. Although most of the partiCipants at the conference came from universities and companies within Ireland, a positive feature of the conference was the extent of interest shown outside of Ireland, resulting in partiCipants from USA, Canada, Austria, and England. The keynote speakers were Professor David Chin, University of Hawaii, and Professor Derek Partridge, University of Exeter, and the topics included machine learning, AI tools and methods, expert systems, speech, vision, natural language, reasoning with uncertain information, and explanation. The sponsors of the conference were Digital Equipment Co (Galway) and the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland.",
